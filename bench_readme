"torch_load_bench.py" is a benchmark for PyTorch's load function, which is commonly used as:
   torch.load(file)

All functions related to load is simulated/copied into torch_load_bench, 
making it a self-contained runnable benchmarks. 

How To Run on Cori @NERSC
 1. module load python/3.6-anaconda-5.2
 2. source activate conda_notebook # The scripts for creating this conda env is not yet public

io_kernel.py is a benchmark for Etalumis, where a few additional functions before torch.load 
is defined/called. 

The two benchmarks should report the IO cost only. The performance should be similar.
